# 🔐 Sign Up and Login Authentication System (PHP + MySQL)

This project is a simple and secure **user authentication system** built using **PHP** and **MySQL**, allowing users to **sign up** and **log in** to a website. It is designed to demonstrate full-stack development fundamentals including form handling, server-side scripting, and backend integration.
